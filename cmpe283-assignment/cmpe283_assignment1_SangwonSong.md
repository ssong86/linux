**Assignment 1**
**Sangwon Song**

**Q1.** For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailng what parts of the lab that member implemented/researched. (You may skip this question if you are doing the lab by yourself).

* This part is skipped. I did the assignment by myself.

**Q2.** Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment. Consider your reader to be someone skilled in software development but otherwise unfamiliar with the assignment. Good answers to this question will be recipes that someone can follow to reproduce your development steps.
**Note:** I may decide to follow these instructions for random assignments, so you should make sure they are accurate. 

* My environment was native Ubuntu (18.04 LTS).
* Forked Linux repository at [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) to a personal repository.
* Clone the repository to my local machine.
* Move to the directory `cd Linux`.
* Modify the source code for hypercall in `linux/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c`.

```bash
apt-get install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev -y
```
* Build kernel by the follwing commands.
```bash
make && make modules && make modules_install && make install
```
* Reboot the system by `reboot` command
* Check the kernel version by `uname -r` command. 
Mine changed from 4.15 to 5.4.0-rc1+

Note: If you insert the module incorrectly, you will get the red commands.

**Q3.** What is the name of your github repo and URL? (Make sure you invite me to that repo â€“ my github ID is mlarkin2015).
The name of github repo is **ssong86/Linux** and the URL is [https://github.com/ssong86/linux](https://github.com/ssong86/linux) 
I also invited mlarkin2015.
